#### A novel approach for interpreting laboratory values in intensive care unit patients

---
**Abstract**:

>Question: Should laboratory abnormalities in critically ill patients be interpreted using a reference range generated from healthy outpatient controls?

>Findings: Proof-of-concept data visualization of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Exposures of interest were the worst first day values for common laboratory tests; outcomes were mortality and length of stay. We found substantial differences between the hospital reference range and the reference ranges generated by ICU patient data, regardless of outcome. For many tests, the observed value is probabilistically associated with outcome.

>Meaning: Laboratory value ranges from critically ill patients deviate significantly from those of healthy controls; therefore, the optimal strategy for the interpretation of ICU lab values may benefit from a more contextual, probabilistic, and outcome-based approach than is currently employed.


**Appendix**

>For each stay, we extracted worst first day results for a panel of laboratory tests routinely ordered for ICU patients. We focused on clinically relevant laboratory values: minimum for albumin, ionized calcium, hemoglobin, and platelets; maximum for creatinine and lactate; and both minimum and maximum for bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium, and white blood cell count.
